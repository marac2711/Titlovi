00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.810
You know, you've got a fair amount
of blood on you there, sir.
3
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.410
Oh.
4
00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:27.710
Yeah, it's not even mine.
5
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.990
There was just this... number one.
6
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.945
Hey, listen, I need
you to take this thing off
7
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.671
my hands and just make
it someone else's problem.
8
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.190
Yeah, I mean, I thought my boys were gonna
love it, but... I'll tell you,
9
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
man, they will not.
10
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.510
No, it's not.
11
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:48.930
Yeah, a toy.
12
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.211
So, don't ever call it that.
13
00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.070
It's a... it's... actually, I don't know
exactly what it is.
14
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.870
Besides, it appears to be broken.
15
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.810
See, the drumstick seems to be stuck in
the up position.
16
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.330
You do not want the goddamn drumstick to
come down.
17
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.230
Okay?
18
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.490
Because when it does, I promise you...
19
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.770
We are all fucked to hell.
20
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.990
Okay?
21
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.970
Well,
22
00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.650
sir, can't speak for you, but... I don't
feel especially fucked to hell.
23
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.490
I don't know if every father passes some
secret horror onto his kid.
24
00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:50.491
kids.
25
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.530
But mine sure did.
26
00:05:10.095 --> 00:05:11.800
My name is Hal Shellborn.
27
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.540
This is me and my twin brother Bill.
28
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.680
Wow.
29
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.800
This is us before everything.
30
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.800
Bill was the kind of kid that would say
shake on it, but then pull his hand back
31
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.151
and pretend to slick his hair.
32
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.760
It was older than me by three minutes and
eight most of my mom's persona.
33
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.280
So that made him my big brother.
34
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.340
I really took seriously and treated me
like a shit whenever he got the chance.
35
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.320
I didn't mean to tell you.
36
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.720
Mom just hates you because you made dad
even though she has to go on dates.
37
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.001
But I managed to love
him anyway, even if I did
38
00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:48.620
sometimes fantasize
about being an only child.
39
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.540
I hate you, Bill Shellborn.
40
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.480
My mom raised us on her own for as long as
she could at least.
41
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.680
And my mom, well, I can remember her
perfectly like it was yesterday.
42
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.860
Your father.
43
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.840
Well, your father went out for a pack of
cigarettes and never came back.
44
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.700
Just me, like an egg and scrap.
45
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.961
And sure, sure, I could have
been one of his stewardesses,
46
00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:30.220
but of course the deadbeat
never took me anywhere.
47
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.360
Just brought back Swiss cuckoo clocks and
bomb dietary.
48
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.100
Nick Knox and souvenirs to stuff are
plausible.
49
00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:47.060
And one day my darling boys, all about
horseshit will be yours.
50
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.518
We know my mom thought
it was a bunch of junk, but for
51
00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:57.640
Bill and me, dad's closet
was full of clues to who he was.
52
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.490
Oh, she is.
53
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.740
Well, that beats the skies.
54
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.140
How's that thing from Paris Frats or
something?
55
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.860
It says organ grinder monkey like life.
56
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.480
I mean, life like dumb shit.
57
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:42.680
Oh, what?
58
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.270
Hey, give me that thing.
59
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:57.890
Here.
60
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.721
Do you think this does junk if I turn
this?
61
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.390
Don't build, dad's.
62
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.210
Dad's gone, fuck face.
63
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.830
And I'm his next of skin, so legally,
everything in your mind.
64
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.870
Stupid things broken, anyway.
65
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.910
Don't come in our room, dumb shit.
66
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.630
Shotgun.
67
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.270
Obviously.
68
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.290
Christ, what's worse than a blind date.
69
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.197
You're one of their
teeth when your hands
70
00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:31.651
doesn't kiss a goddamn
frog and see what happens.
71
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.690
Okay, boys.
72
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.010
No soda after you brush your teeth.
73
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.410
And no fires.
74
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.810
And no video games because of the last
fire.
75
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.970
I tried to tell him no fires, but these
boys are nothing but willish.
76
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.010
Thank you, babysitter Annie.
77
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.930
I'll be on my midnight.
78
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.820
Okay, boys, got only one roll for tonight.
79
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.960
Keep your hands off the hot parts of the
table, okay?
80
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.820
I'll try, but... just a man.
81
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.040
I'll pill, knock it off.
82
00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.630
Hey!
83
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.550
Maybe an experience like that could have
brought me in bill closer.
84
00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:10.230
But it turned out one freak tragedy wasn't
going to be nearly enough.
85
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.370
I was her head still together.
86
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:24.060
Oh, yeah.
87
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.180
Today, you're here with Annie Wilkes.
88
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.290
Gone by accident.
89
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.580
Rather in an accident because,
you know, there's no accidents.
90
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.620
Is there a divine plan?
91
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.320
Sure, you know.
92
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.940
Maybe.
93
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.260
Call it a coin toss, you know.
94
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:46.261
No heads or tails.
95
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:55.360
But not Annie's head because that is
separate.
96
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.580
That's a separate issue.
97
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.500
You know why her?
98
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.800
So, right?
99
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.380
Why Annie?
100
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.840
Why not you?
101
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.850
Or you?
102
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.920
Everything for a reason.
103
00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.620
Yeah, totally.
104
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.160
And it is what it is.
105
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.910
It is what it is.
106
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.990
The word of the Lord.
107
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.450
Everything is an accident.
108
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.370
Or nothing is an accident.
109
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.770
Either way.
110
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.010
Same thing.
111
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.850
It's not if or even how.
112
00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:44.410
It's only when.
113
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.730
Everybody dies.
114
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.010
And that's why I'll die.
115
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.550
And you will both die.
116
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.430
And all of your friends and their parents
and all of their pets and everybody.
117
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.010
Some of us peacefully in our sleep.
118
00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:17.450
And some of us horribly violently died up
with clothesline.
119
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.550
Screaming through duct tape over our
mouths and all that jazz.
120
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.190
And hell with it.
121
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.210
Let's go dancing.
122
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.800
I've been on
123
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.880
the day of a funeral.
124
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.040
But that probably was the happiest day of
my life.
125
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.820
That's funny how quickly that can change.
126
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.620
Hey.
127
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.900
Kid.
128
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.020
Your brother says your dad left your mom.
129
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.800
Let out to pair his friends.
130
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.756
To buy cigarettes because you're a big fat
baby.
131
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.800
You cry all the time.
132
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.320
And man.
133
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.060
Don't you moms deserve better?
134
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.120
I mean, don't she?
135
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.340
So I guess that means your mom will be
wearing the pants in the house now, huh?
136
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.680
I think that's how it works, yeah.
137
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.340
Oh, but see, you're wearing pants.
138
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.660
And two people can't be wearing the pants
in the house at the same time.
139
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.040
So looks like you got yourself a bit of a
pants problem, kid.
140
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.030
Honey, I'm making PB&J.
141
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160
Oh, wait.
142
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.850
How am I going over my two sons all day
long?
143
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.680
Why don't you put dad's wear and monkey in
our room?
144
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.760
You know I don't go in there anymore since
I found that step sock.
145
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:53.080
Oh, yeah.
146
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.070
You didn't have anything to do with my
babysitter's head right?
147
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.690
That'd be like, yo.
148
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.510
You really got the hots for that thing,
huh?
149
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:17.730
I don't.
150
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.910
It's all good.
151
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.310
You can have it, but I got to do say you
want to marry.
152
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.130
I don't want to marry you.
153
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.830
Say, I want to be Mrs. Stupid Monkey.
154
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.870
I want to be Mrs. Stupid Monkey.
155
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.350
I'll say...
156
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.910
I want to suck it's banana.
157
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.710
No, Phil.
158
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.130
No.
159
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.630
Say it or I'll eat the rest of your
placenta, bitch.
160
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.170
I want to suck it's banana.
161
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.170
All right.
162
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.710
You have a deal.
163
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.770
You can have the monkey.
164
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.710
Eat
165
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.750
it.
166
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.980
Yo, Mrs. Torrance.
167
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.800
How she opens, joking his monkey under his
desk.
168
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.560
You're
169
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.830
making devil's food.
170
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.510
I don't fucking want any.
171
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.990
Who talks to their mother like that?
172
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.070
What do you want to say?
173
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.510
What kind of shit am I?
174
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.790
You.
175
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.430
It's because of you that that be built in
this to me.
176
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.390
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?
177
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.970
That asshole kid who lives in here with
me?
178
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.910
That's Bill.
179
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.980
You want to know something else?
180
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.690
I wish Bill was dead.
181
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.760
Hey mom, you're home.
182
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.560
Is that not ready?
183
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240
Mom.
184
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.370
No, you've been making it yet.
185
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.760
What the fuck?
186
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.410
The doctors call what happened to my mama,
boomerang aneurysm.
187
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.990
But I was the only one who knew what it
really was.
188
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.030
They said chances of it happening were one
in 44 million.
189
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.630
And that's just another way to say.
190
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.350
It has to happen to somebody.
191
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.550
And that's how it works.
192
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.990
You turn the key and the drumsticks go up.
193
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.390
They come down again when it chooses who
wants to kill next.
194
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.450
It doesn't take requests.
195
00:21:39.915 --> 00:21:43.090
It kills who it wants when it feels like
it.
196
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.430
And it doesn't owe you an explanation.
197
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:48.390
It's true what it says on the box.
198
00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.290
It's just like life.
199
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.580
Son, perhaps it's best.
200
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.100
Shut up.
201
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
Hey mom.
202
00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.780
Mom, wake up.
203
00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.260
Mom?
204
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.900
Mom, that's a funny joke.
205
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.580
Mom.
206
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
You
207
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.150
know your anidone, your uncle chip.
208
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.010
Never wanted kids.
209
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.150
No.
210
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.453
Always just kind of
prefer to life where you sit
211
00:23:15.503 --> 00:23:18.570
down and you don't stand
up again until you want to.
212
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.110
Also, we're swingers, but oh well.
213
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.980
I want you to know we're going to do our
very best with you boys.
214
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:46.220
It's just that our very best might be
pretty bad.
215
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920
The fuck?
216
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.760
I put the pieces in a garbage bag and made
sure it got on the garbage truck and I
217
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.410
assume that would be the end of it.
218
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.440
After that, Bill and I were never the
same.
219
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:22.560
I mean, we looked the same because we
were twins and... You know what I mean?
220
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.140
And Ida and Uncle Chip picked up Bill and
me and moved us to Maine.
221
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.460
And I guess I hope we'd left the worst of
it behind us.
222
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.000
They say everything and be replaced.
223
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.760
They say every distance is not near.
224
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.380
So I remember everything.
225
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.490
I'm going to take off your suit,
Bill.
226
00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.711
If I take it off and I'll have to put it
back on as soon as there's another funeral.
227
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.590
Or if I don't take it off then I won't
have to put it back on.
228
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.050
So there won't be any more funerals.
229
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.800
Sleep tight, you two.
230
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.550
Why'd you bring it?
231
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:08.010
I didn't.
232
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.930
I chopped it up.
233
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.410
Don't look chopped up to me.
234
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880
I'm telling you, Bill.
235
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:13.950
It's a bad monkey.
236
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.530
It's a bad, bad, killer monkey.
237
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.110
I think he killed babysitter Annie.
238
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.070
Maybe?
239
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.130
Probably, I don't know.
240
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.430
I was going to marry that girl.
241
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.170
I know you would, Bill.
242
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.240
We should try it on purpose to see if
anyone else we know dies.
243
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.730
No, no, we shouldn't.
244
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.206
I mean, what if we get to one of us?
245
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.710
Then I promised her pretend to be sad when
you're dead.
246
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.930
Yeah, me too.
247
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.840
You think you could kill the person who
turns the key or not?
248
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.460
How the hell should I know?
249
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.530
Do you think Mom turned it?
250
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.970
I'm going to try it.
251
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.150
Don't, Bill.
252
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.750
It was a hunting accident, but not the
usual kind.
253
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.594
Uncle Chip was trampled
by a stampede of 67
254
00:29:19.595 --> 00:29:22.891
wild horses in a sleeping
bag on a camping trip.
255
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.599
I overheard the undertakers say
that when they dumped the body
256
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.570
out, it looked like someone
had dropped kick to cherry pie.
257
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.870
I don't mind what the Uncle Chip's gone.
258
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.650
It was kind of an asshole.
259
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.810
I just mind more that I feel pretty good
wasn't me.
260
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.690
But it's got to be done, you know?
261
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.830
To keep it away from the people who might
feel really good about using it.
262
00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:52.050
The Nazis and Russians and our wrong keys
and whatnot.
263
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.371
We knew that it couldn't be destroyed, so
we hoped that we could maybe contain it.
264
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.530
Just get rid of it.
265
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.650
And make it go to fuck away.
266
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.430
And for a long time, anyway, it really
seemed like it had.
267
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.060
I haven't seen the monkey since we threw
it down the well.
268
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.180
But it feels like only a matter of time
before it comes back.
269
00:34:05.995 --> 00:34:07.520
This is me today.
270
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.260
I'm pretty much lost all contact with
Bill, and I'm good with that.
271
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.340
He was kind of an asshole, anyway.
272
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.160
I don't have any friends, and I do my best
to stay away from family.
273
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.980
For fear that if the monkey returns,
I don't kill someone close to me.
274
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.500
But staying away from family, that's
easier said than done.
275
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.270
Hey, Dwight.
276
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:38.890
Oh, man.
277
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.790
Come in, come in.
278
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.770
Oh, no, it's cool.
279
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:42.510
I got to run early today.
280
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:43.650
I got to pick up my kid.
281
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.930
Wait, you got a kid?
282
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.770
Shit, man, that sucks.
283
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.770
Does it look with you?
284
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.330
I know.
285
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.530
No, he doesn't.
286
00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.330
But I get seen once a year, so I'm taking
him to a horror heaven.
287
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.370
Well, the coasters, I guess.
288
00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:04.130
Once a year, shit, man, that sucks.
289
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.720
I bet you expect some type of megabitch,
huh?
290
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:14.740
Oh, no, the once a year thing that was my
idea.
291
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.460
It turns out I'm kind of a bad influence.
292
00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:22.580
Here comes trouble.
293
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:23.900
Who you?
294
00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.820
It's not like, you know, I've beheld a
pale horse, and on it was a pale writer,
295
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.540
and the writer's name was, you know,
death.
296
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.340
But, yeah, that has been some of the
other.
297
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:42.620
Shit, man, that sucks.
298
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.470
Of
299
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.770
our rental energy transferred from you to
me.
300
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.370
Peter's been asking about you more and
more how.
301
00:36:42.415 --> 00:36:44.090
Man, it's breaking our hearts.
302
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.520
About me?
303
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160
What about me?
304
00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:49.700
What?
305
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.586
Because your his father,
and he's doing a family tree
306
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:56.840
school project, and like or
not, you're one of the branches.
307
00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.140
Look, I care about Peter.
308
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I do.
309
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:04.890
I care about him a lot.
310
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200
Like, a lot.
311
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.180
Just now, when we were on the couch
together, I took your power.
312
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.820
Well, well, well, well, I never said you
could take my power.
313
00:37:13.821 --> 00:37:15.340
It doesn't matter anymore.
314
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.041
But Ted has decided to legally adopt
Peter.
315
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.220
What?
316
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.648
And once the adoption
is finalized, it won't
317
00:37:20.649 --> 00:37:23.480
be necessary for
you to see Peter at all.
318
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.260
But you can't just do that.
319
00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:27.320
You can't just do that.
320
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.740
That's the leading expert in my field.
321
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680
Can't I?
322
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.520
Listen, you and Peter have this time.
323
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:42.280
So just take the week, lock in some nice
memories, and then cleanly cut it off.
324
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.780
Like a vestigial tail.
325
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:49.480
That's what you want, isn't it?
326
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.500
No.
327
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.900
It's not what I want.
328
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.720
I want to spend time with Peter.
329
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.960
It's just, you know, a vestigial.
330
00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.020
It means something that has become
functionless.
331
00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.840
And as a result, there's no longer
necessary.
332
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:01.620
I know what it means, Ted.
333
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.300
I'm sure you do.
334
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:02.620
I do.
335
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.180
Well, I have your power.
336
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.660
So, well, like, Peter wanted your bushes
on the way in.
337
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.061
So... Now, this is the part where
I suggest that we... I miss all.
338
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.300
I miss all for what?
339
00:38:11.301 --> 00:38:12.301
For all the marbles.
340
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.500
And by marbles, I am of course referring
to your little balls.
341
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:17.280
My...
342
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.460
Honey.
343
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520
Oh, Peter.
344
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.160
Hey.
345
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860
Hey, buddy.
346
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.011
What are you guys talking about?
347
00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.460
It mean it reminds you of your dad.
348
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:45.200
You're talking about the shitting grin or
the hairy back-and-ons.
349
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.890
Did you ever wonder where he is?
350
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:53.530
Oh, dad, I mean.
351
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.610
Baby, that ain't worth it.
352
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:05.494
But if you're really looking
for an answer, I'd have
353
00:40:05.495 --> 00:40:09.730
to go with either at a card
table or under a hooker.
354
00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:10.731
Yes.
355
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.030
Mark, come on, I have a cross.
356
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:17.210
It both sounds honey.
357
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.630
If you want a drag.
358
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.001
But you're still thinking
of selling that monkey
359
00:40:27.002 --> 00:40:29.731
thing to the nut who
never leaves his house.
360
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.190
I'm gonna be ever even met this guy
face-to-face.
361
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.870
Sounds like a real fucking pervert to me.
362
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.650
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?
363
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.781
Is that your family treating?
364
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.070
I'll give it away.
365
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.470
Okay.
366
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.190
So, brothers, sisters?
367
00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.790
Yes, no.
368
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.070
Oh, no.
369
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.230
No, it's a both.
370
00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:16.730
Yeah, no, neither.
371
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.070
Let me tell.
372
00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.890
Just like me.
373
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.130
What's your mom's name?
374
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.930
Lois.
375
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.710
Your mom's name is...
376
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.800
I'm gonna get a late time.
377
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.060
She'll get you some dinner, huh?
378
00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.600
Oh, if you want me to like survive.
379
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:55.380
Yeah.
380
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:02.750
Cool.
381
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080
Everybody did it.
382
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.260
Christ.
383
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.620
Hello.
384
00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420
Hello.
385
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.270
How did you know I didn't reach me,
Bill?
386
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.530
I haven't heard from you in about five
years.
387
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.150
I haven't seen you in like ten.
388
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:23.290
What do you mean the police?
389
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.210
I have to.
390
00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:27.410
It's like that.
391
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:28.750
It's no more.
392
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:30.190
Oh, shit.
393
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.610
I guess she was kind of old.
394
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.890
Was she sick or something?
395
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.970
Well, actually it seems the old girl was
having someone.
396
00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.370
Okay, and what?
397
00:44:53.855 --> 00:44:56.656
Someone has to go through her belongings
and you're in the next of kin.
398
00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.770
Technically, you're the next of kin,
Bill.
399
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.130
And this is my week with Katie,
so no.
400
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.890
You're weak.
401
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.570
That's all you get with your son.
402
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.950
Also, you're weak.
403
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.210
What do you want, Bill?
404
00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:10.850
Go to an item house and make sure it isn't
there.
405
00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:12.590
It is at the bottom of a well.
406
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:19.050
It can teleport and
you interchange.
407
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:20.430
Jesus.
408
00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:27.880
Why would it be at an item is anyway?
409
00:45:27.881 --> 00:45:30.780
Because it attaches itself to our family
and likes to kill us.
410
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.260
I don't want to die in prison.
411
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.060
You don't want me to die either.
412
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.700
What am I supposed to do?
413
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.980
Drop it from a fucking plane.
414
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.060
You're probably bounce.
415
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.316
No, you've never let it out of your sight
again.
416
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.640
So no one turns the key.
417
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:47.120
I'm presumably you don't want Katie to
stop talking about Katie.
418
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.381
The monkey must be vanquished.
419
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.300
Why don't you van?
420
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.620
Where's Bill?
421
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.880
You're smaller.
422
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.120
You go.
423
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.880
Bill.
424
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.211
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
425
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:46.770
Katie.
426
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.090
We got to go.
427
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:48.470
We got to go.
428
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:49.890
What's going on?
429
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.550
What the fuck?
430
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:52.890
Hey, language.
431
00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:53.930
And we got to go.
432
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:54.130
All right.
433
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.530
They were there.
434
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.590
There was a thing outside.
435
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:58.610
It wasn't a thing.
436
00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:00.150
It was one.
437
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.670
And either way, we got to split.
438
00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:02.070
All right.
439
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:02.870
So come on, let's go.
440
00:47:02.871 --> 00:47:03.906
It's the middle of the night.
441
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:04.530
Are you high?
442
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.870
No.
443
00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.170
I wish Jesus Christ.
444
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:07.790
No, I don't do drugs.
445
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.330
I mean it.
446
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:08.950
Come on.
447
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:09.410
Let's go.
448
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:09.870
Hurry up.
449
00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:10.590
I'm going to bed.
450
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:11.750
We're your mate.
451
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:34.270
Hey, Katie.
452
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.830
Sorry about that.
453
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:37.470
It's just my entire diet.
454
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.090
I've got to deal with a lot of our stuff.
455
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.050
Can I ask you a question?
456
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.570
I'm really aware that he didn't.
457
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.690
How'd your mom die?
458
00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.476
Just for your family tree
thing, because usually
459
00:47:52.477 --> 00:47:54.040
family trees are about
to lose in the wind.
460
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.780
It's not that wise in the house.
461
00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.461
Was your aunt the one that raised you
after your mom died?
462
00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760
Yeah.
463
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:07.220
Yeah.
464
00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:08.380
Yeah, she did.
465
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.610
Maybe you could take me to your own house
with you.
466
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.550
I can help you with your stuff.
467
00:48:16.551 --> 00:48:18.071
And you cannot come over with my baby.
468
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:18.450
Why not?
469
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.410
Because it's depressing.
470
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:21.030
All right.
471
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.910
We're supposed to go to a theme park.
472
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.350
Not into, you know, darkness and death.
473
00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.530
I know about the adoption home.
474
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960
Oh.
475
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.380
And so you can either just cut me off and
cut this off.
476
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.081
Or you can spend the rest of it.
477
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.260
Every little time that we have left
together.
478
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.060
I wonder
479
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.470
if one lowers what he chosen.
480
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.890
What are you doing in here all alone now?
481
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.810
Where do I not want to know?
482
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:17.690
Just thinking, I guess.
483
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.990
Oh, yeah.
484
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:20.930
About what?
485
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.310
I don't know.
486
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:23.790
The future.
487
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:26.430
You got me in vice.
488
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.201
Well, take care of your teeth.
489
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.361
And take care of your gut.
490
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:38.790
Take life as it comes.
491
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.810
You know, the worst thing you can do is
try to force it.
492
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:49.390
But really, I think that the most
important thing for you to remember is...
493
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:53.470
Try not to kill everybody around you.
494
00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.370
Aah!
495
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:06.890
Beanie.
496
00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.480
Ready?
497
00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.420
Hey, Beanie, buddy.
498
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:41.890
Check it out.
499
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:43.410
There's a place in town.
500
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.790
They'd just try nothin' lessons.
501
00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:46.226
I feel like it's one of those things.
502
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.110
We were really good at it.
503
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.270
And you aren't.
504
00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:50.010
I want to come and listen to find out.
505
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.350
Hey, funny.
506
00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.450
That's funny.
507
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:56.270
Yeah.
508
00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:58.090
We were kind of funny too, huh?
509
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.650
Oh, and they do weddings.
510
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.500
Hey, yeah.
511
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760
We're doing me a favor.
512
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.220
All right.
513
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.640
We're in the car.
514
00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.810
All I deal with is...
515
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.080
What?
516
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:22.580
No way.
517
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.816
I want to see your old room.
518
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.920
Let me do it in the movies.
519
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.480
No, Beanie.
520
00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:26.780
You want to.
521
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.541
Just because...
Because I said so.
522
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.140
All right.
523
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320
Fine.
524
00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.300
Then I have to go number two.
525
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.380
What?
526
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.696
Why don't you go to the motel?
527
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.400
There's a lot you don't know about me how.
528
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:43.820
For instance, I'm one of those kids that
can only go poo in a house.
529
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.540
Everything's serious.
530
00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.700
That's a tough bet to lose how.
531
00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:53.780
Jesus Christ.
532
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.340
Hey.
533
00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.780
Hey there.
534
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:56.820
Sorry.
535
00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.760
Oh, I know I'm going to go down.
536
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:00.300
Hey there.
537
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:00.860
How are you?
538
00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.300
I'm Barbara.
539
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.080
You must be Hal Shelborn.
540
00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.600
Your brother Bill Shelborn said you'd be
coming.
541
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.700
Oh, yeah.
542
00:52:07.701 --> 00:52:08.701
Right, right.
543
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.380
Hi Barbara.
544
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.960
That brother Bill of yours is quite the
character, isn't he?
545
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.280
Yeah.
546
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.660
Your brother Bill, I mean.
547
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.480
Yes, yes.
548
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:16.800
He's quite the character.
549
00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.520
Yeah.
550
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.620
Wow, who's this little slugger?
551
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.440
Oh, this is my son Petey.
552
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.600
Oh, hello there.
553
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:24.740
Oh, no thanks Barbara.
554
00:52:24.965 --> 00:52:27.240
I'm just a kid who doesn't buy many
houses.
555
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.800
But I also didn't know that I have an
uncle.
556
00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:30.820
So, yeah.
557
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.080
Thanks for that.
558
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.940
It's funny because I actually asked Hal
here if he had no siblings yesterday.
559
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.020
But he flat out lied to my face.
560
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.360
But it's cool.
561
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.460
He's only gonna be my dad for like a few
more days anyway.
562
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.980
Because he's being swapped out for a
leading expert.
563
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.300
Yeah.
564
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:48.000
Okay.
565
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520
Yeah.
566
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:49.900
Okay.
567
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:50.500
Well.
568
00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:51.440
So no card.
569
00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:51.940
Okay.
570
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.160
No card, yeah.
571
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.220
Were you and your aunt very close?
572
00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360
Sure.
573
00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.140
Is this all her stuff?
574
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.620
I feel like she had more stuff.
575
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.760
Oh, well, we did have that estate sale
that day after she died.
576
00:53:05.761 --> 00:53:07.780
We had a great turnout too.
577
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:09.660
Must have made over a hundred dollars.
578
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:10.980
Right.
579
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:14.870
Now, let's see.
580
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.451
That would have been on Sunday.
581
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.060
Because ever since Monday, things have
been a bit messy around here.
582
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.980
Yeah, your aunt, of course, was Monday.
583
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.760
And then, oh Lord, first thing Tuesday,
it was Mitch McDonald's.
584
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.960
And then Wednesday was Bert Bergerson.
585
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.600
And then Nancy Risoli.
586
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.990
Any cobras and mayonnaise, are there?
587
00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:00.330
Well, there was the one.
588
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:06.330
No, every day since Monday, at least one
casco local has just poof.
589
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:14.270
Sometimes two, or three, or four,
or even five, casco locals have just poof
590
00:54:14.395 --> 00:54:15.630
and poof and poof.
591
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:16.470
Great, yeah.
592
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.830
Yeah, no.
593
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.490
I get it.
594
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.810
Can we look at the other closet?
595
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.190
Is this where I think?
596
00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.190
Absolutely.
597
00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:23.450
Follow me.
598
00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:24.770
Poof.
599
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.450
Your fucking twins?
600
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:45.970
No, my mother used to always say whenever
there was a plane crash, or a school bus
601
00:54:45.971 --> 00:54:49.750
going off into the river and mass
fatalities, or what have you.
602
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:53.630
She used to always say, looks like God's
bullying strikes tonight.
603
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.310
Oh, that's odd.
604
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:00.870
I don't remember locking this.
605
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.793
Yeah, you wouldn't
have to remember if my
606
00:55:03.794 --> 00:55:07.631
aunt had a wind-up toy
monkey at the archer.
607
00:55:08.235 --> 00:55:09.490
No, I don't think so.
608
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.450
Oh, not a cherished childhood memory now,
was it?
609
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.850
Oh, first little furry friend filled with
whimsy and wonder.
610
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:18.970
No, it is.
611
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.150
No, no big deal.
612
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.230
Oh, okay.
613
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.450
Nope, not that one.
614
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.650
How are we doing that key?
615
00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:32.830
Oh, don't you worry.
616
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.550
You're pretty little head.
617
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.571
Oh, Marcy, did I say that out loud?
618
00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:39.250
Watch out.
619
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.570
You are pretty, though.
620
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880
You know what?
621
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.260
I actually think we should go down.
622
00:55:59.261 --> 00:56:01.400
We should go down a little process of
elimination.
623
00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.440
No, no, no, no!
624
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.150
Is everything abandoned?
625
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.640
Yeah, everything's fine.
626
00:56:48.165 --> 00:56:50.420
And you were just standing there,
hands to yourself.
627
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.060
Is that right?
628
00:56:51.061 --> 00:56:52.061
Yeah, that's right.
629
00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:55.260
And do you know there was a gun in the
house or not so much?
630
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.580
No.
631
00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:01.336
I'm going to have to ask you.
632
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.416
Don't leave town until we can figure a few
things out.
633
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440
No, no, no, officer.
634
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.876
I promised my son that I was going to take
him to horror heaven.
635
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.900
I'm actually officer.
636
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.840
We moved off going to horror heaven.
637
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.680
This is obviously far more important.
638
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.200
Smart kid.
639
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.320
Find a motel.
640
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.740
I'd say stay here, but it's a goddamn mess
in there.
641
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.680
I mean, have you actually been up there?
642
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:21.851
It's like that restaurant.
643
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.880
Spaghetti city.
644
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.000
Yeah.
645
00:57:27.001 --> 00:57:28.860
Hey bud, you want to win the car?
646
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.760
That's your favorite thing for me to do
anyway, isn't it?
647
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.960
Just stay away.
648
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.730
Am I able to.
649
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.790
Yeah, look, we're fine, but the mucky's
not here.
650
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.975
And I had to have a
goddamn yard sale, so it could
651
00:58:32.999 --> 00:58:35.190
have been, but now it could
be anywhere with anyone.
652
00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:36.570
Well, that's not good.
653
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:37.550
That's bad.
654
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.070
Yeah, it was all kind of shit happening in
town.
655
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.710
People dying in not normal ways.
656
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.031
Please don't mean I can't leave.
657
00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:45.550
Go to a motel.
658
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:46.450
I'll wait my signal.
659
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:48.070
Oh, wait your fucking signal!
660
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:53.310
Wait, Bill, where are you?
661
00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:55.230
Bill, are you living in town?
662
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.210
Sound born.
663
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:23.510
Sound born.
664
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:24.510
Sound born.
665
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:25.650
No.
666
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:40.170
Mrs. Monkey?
667
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:44.370
This
668
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:52.420
is in regards to my head.
669
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.540
I'm happy the report key is over.
670
00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:00.460
Thank you for going, and be safe out
there.
671
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.310
It's
672
01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.480
my moment to use slip from my fingers.
673
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.080
I suddenly knew the terrible truths about
everything.
674
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.260
That my dumb shit brother had turned your
key and killed my mom.
675
01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:04.050
So I went back to get you as soon as I
could, but you were gone.
676
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:12.350
Leaving behind a sign for me and only me,
that one day you'd be back.
677
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:16.790
And so I waited.
678
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:22.890
And for the longest time, there was
nothing.
679
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.430
A hundred percent pure medical grade,
nothingness.
680
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.740
There you were.
681
01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.420
Just
682
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:15.950
to test the sun, the moon and the stars.
683
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:20.090
As if you had always been looking down on
me.
684
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.730
Letting me know what I had always wanted
to be true.
685
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:28.870
That you'd come back to help me seek my
revenge.
686
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:37.032
I returned to the places
where I thought you might be
687
01:02:37.033 --> 01:02:40.450
foolishly believing that I
could make you appear again.
688
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.450
That it was I who might find you again.
689
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.630
So I made myself ready for your turn.
690
01:02:52.631 --> 01:03:00.950
We're working my old childhood funeral suit
in anticipation of, well, more funerals.
691
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:07.010
And so that I'd like once again,
bear witness to your terrible glory.
692
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:15.290
So I looked in the home of a pale horse.
693
01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.900
And his name that sat on him was death.
694
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.370
This is my key.
695
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.010
And now here we are.
696
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:30.550
Together at last, with only one thing left
to do.
697
01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:35.060
Anyhow, infinite wisdom.
698
01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.420
I trust you, flaming sword of
righteousness.
699
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.820
I'll cut the foul air, and smite the right
person.
700
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:50.440
And I know you know exactly what I'm
talking about.
701
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:10.820
Excuse me, they're sucks.
702
01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:22.730
What?
703
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.930
What is it?
704
01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:27.110
I'm extremely busy.
705
01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.950
Well, I hope this isn't weird,
but I was wondering, maybe I could give
706
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:36.870
you your 15 bucks back and instead I could
just keep the toy monkey thing.
707
01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:38.821
It's not a toy, don't ever call it that.
708
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:57.390
Does it hurt very much when you think
Ricky?
709
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.370
Well, I thought well, well...
710
01:05:02.371 --> 01:05:07.650
Did you know that 27% of all
English-speaking people will either say,
711
01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.970
oh shit, or holy shit before they die?
712
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:15.850
Now it's funny, because death is the one
big thing that'll happen to all of us.
713
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.790
And yet we still can't help but be.
714
01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.070
Right on, man.
715
01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:29.090
So anyway, it's not...
716
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:34.390
It looks like you, but that's like,
uh...
717
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.060
What if Peteie turned the key?
718
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.000
So, could I have it back?
719
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680
Never.
720
01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:51.280
I'm going to find the monkey not to fall
in love with it.
721
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:13.290
No, you owe me you're the factory!
722
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320
You're most yours!
723
01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.160
You got any extra bullets?
724
01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:39.840
What caliber?
725
01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:51.700
Yeah, you still got some of Barbara's
loadin' you.
726
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.380
Yeah.
727
01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.980
That accident's happen.
728
01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:01.830
Can I ask you a question?
729
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.730
Nope.
730
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.520
You ever killed him?
731
01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840
All right.
732
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.340
Jesus.
733
01:07:20.655 --> 01:07:21.740
This mom, no?
734
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.440
No, all right.
735
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.900
I haven't killed anybody.
736
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.060
Of course, I haven't killed anybody.
737
01:07:27.945 --> 01:07:30.253
Look, when we get back
to the motel, I'm going to call
738
01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:32.480
your mom, and I'm going
to tell her what happened.
739
01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:38.180
If you don't think I'm not sick to be
around, then... You should be right.
740
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.880
So, Ted, what just to tell me?
741
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.960
You'll never have to see me again.
742
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.260
You better have a Ted, all right?
743
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.030
Believe me.
744
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:54.220
Look in there.
745
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:03.430
Hey, Pete.
746
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.310
Well, I'm here if you need me.
747
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.370
You just do your thing in the bathroom,
okay?
748
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:16.510
Yeah, not.
749
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.201
If you want to have a talk, we can have a
proper talk, all right?
750
01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
Yes.
751
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.500
It's me.
752
01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.320
You haven't done it.
753
01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.680
I know, baby.
754
01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:36.600
Come on, Bill.
755
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.480
This isn't what we need.
756
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.280
I know you'll have it.
757
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:38.700
What am I?
758
01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.380
Stop turning the teeth.
759
01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.916
These arms aren't fucking
long enough for articulate
760
01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:46.400
enough to reach back there
itself, so somebody has to.
761
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.760
And also, no.
762
01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:50.260
Jesus fucking Christ.
763
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.220
Bill, these are innocent people.
764
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.240
Look, I don't care about me.
765
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.140
All that matters is the PDF safe.
766
01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.620
So stop turning it.
767
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.236
You want me to stop turning the key?
768
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.460
Bring pity to me so he can turn it in
instead.
769
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:02.980
What?
770
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.320
No, why?
771
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.220
The person who turns the key never dies.
772
01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.760
You know, that's where the kids have to do
now.
773
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.080
What?
774
01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.241
What are you talking about?
775
01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:14.980
Where are you, Bill?
776
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:20.800
If you want pity to be safe, all pity has
to do is turn the key and keep turning the
777
01:09:20.801 --> 01:09:25.440
key forever and never and never and pity
will never die.
778
01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.040
Listen to me, Bill, all right.
779
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.580
Let me get pity out of here.
780
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.300
Then we'll talk.
781
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.660
All right, we will figure out what we're
going to do.
782
01:09:31.661 --> 01:09:34.720
Either I keep turning the key or pity
turns the key.
783
01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.380
We'll call me back when you made your
decision.
784
01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.621
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Bill.
785
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.180
Hey, pity, pity.
786
01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.080
Hey, pity.
787
01:09:52.081 --> 01:09:53.081
Hey, pity.
788
01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.060
Hey, buddy, we got to go, all right.
789
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.840
I got to take you back to your mom's.
790
01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.440
pity, open the door.
791
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.580
Come on.
792
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680
pity.
793
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060
pity, open the door.
794
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.520
Come on, we got to go right now.
795
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320
Jesus Christ.
796
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.380
I'll have a heart attack.
797
01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.500
Or do.
798
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.656
You want out of my life so bad it might
just be a nice shortcut.
799
01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.400
What the fuck?
800
01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.840
Why didn't you answer the door?
801
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.706
Why would you even
have a kid if all you're
802
01:10:24.707 --> 01:10:26.380
going to do is just keep
yourself away from me?
803
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.736
I didn't exactly know what I was doing.
804
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.840
All right, I was just a stupid,
dumb kid.
805
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940
So I was an accident?
806
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.180
Is that what you were saying?
807
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.321
Everything is an accident.
808
01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.460
Yes.
809
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:39.160
Well, nice woman.
810
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.740
Great to hear.
811
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.220
That's not funny.
812
01:10:56.225 --> 01:10:58.070
Yes, it was an accident, pity.
813
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:02.930
But you're not a mistake.
814
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:10.400
I'm so glad you're here with me.
815
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.540
You're very precious to me.
816
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:21.280
That's why I stay away because I come with
all sorts of weird baggage.
817
01:11:21.281 --> 01:11:22.996
And I don't want you to have to deal with
that.
818
01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.020
Like what?
819
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:26.080
Like bad stuff, pity.
820
01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:29.880
Like evil stuff.
821
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.500
Stuff that I got from my dad and I don't
want to pass it on to you.
822
01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.360
What are you talking about?
823
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.540
Like what?
824
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.990
Like...
825
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.870
Open up to the motherfucking police!
826
01:11:49.025 --> 01:11:52.250
All right, all right, all right,
got it.
827
01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:53.251
Shut up!
828
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:54.450
Shut up!
829
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.060
Relax.
830
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:57.510
Just relax.
831
01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.190
Get the keys.
832
01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:00.270
Come on!
833
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:06.550
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.
834
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.150
We can't go for a little drive.
835
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.260
All right, stop here.
836
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.560
Where are we?
837
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400
Huh?
838
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.020
Where are we?
839
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.751
What's your brother's house?
840
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.080
Where's fortress?
841
01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.376
Don't pretend like you don't know where we
are.
842
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.800
I don't know, all right, we're...
843
01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.416
You know, we're estranged.
844
01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.220
Shit, man, that sucks.
845
01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480
Shut up!
846
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540
Okay.
847
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.101
You... You go inside.
848
01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.760
You make nice with your uncle.
849
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:06.100
You get me the monkey and you bring it
out.
850
01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:06.640
Okay.
851
01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680
What monkey?
852
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.310
It's got a little red vest.
853
01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:14.130
And it holds a drum and I need it.
854
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.406
What is this guy now about a monkey?
855
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.590
And I don't.
856
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:18.026
He doesn't know about the monkey and he's
not going in there.
857
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.710
It's a toy monkey.
858
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:21.010
Don't call it that, all right?
859
01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:22.150
It's not.
860
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:23.210
It's evil.
861
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.630
It's basically the devil, all right?
862
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.450
It's a toy monkey.
863
01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:28.670
I was gonna tell you when you were older.
864
01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:29.230
Okay.
865
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:32.050
You've been a god damn deadbeat dad
because of a toy monkey.
866
01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:32.730
What the fuck?
867
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:33.790
Hey, language.
868
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:37.390
And yes, but that's why we have to get as
far away from this place as possible.
869
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.850
You got to hope that you get that god damn
monkey because I'm gonna shoot this guy.
870
01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:42.240
All right, just let me...
871
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:43.620
Let me go in there with him.
872
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:44.621
No!
873
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:48.288
There is a doggy door
around back and you're
874
01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:50.841
kid better hope that he's
scrawny enough to fit.
875
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.460
You don't call the cops or do anything.
876
01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.220
You get in there.
877
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:55.320
You get me the monkey.
878
01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.460
Or I swear I'm gonna shoot you both a lot
of times.
879
01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.660
He's not going in there.
880
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.840
Shut up!
881
01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920
All right.
882
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600
Go.
883
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
Hell.
884
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.220
This is some fucked up shit.
885
01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080
I know.
886
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:12.540
It's whatever you do.
887
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.500
Don't turn the key in the monkey's back.
888
01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.640
Okay, okay.
889
01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:21.190
Fuck.
890
01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:40.080
Huh.
891
01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.220
They're kinda cool.
892
01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:43.940
I guess.
893
01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.980
You know, really a cop, right?
894
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.040
Shut up.
895
01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:18.150
Of course not.
896
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.040
I hate cops.
897
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.080
And my dad was a cop.
898
01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.460
Still is.
899
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.620
For all I know.
900
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:28.277
You know, my mom said
he was out chasing pussy, but
901
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:30.460
I'm all like there's pussy
here in town, you know?
902
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:30.560
Yeah.
903
01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.860
Whatever.
904
01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.340
He left.
905
01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.000
And that's why I hate cops.
906
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:36.986
We're also the cops, you know?
907
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.410
She's the best reason to hate cops.
908
01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.900
What the hell is that doing there?
909
01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.420
All right, what were your brides?
910
01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.080
Hit it with my brides, okay.
911
01:16:58.195 --> 01:16:59.360
Oh, gross.
912
01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.580
Shut it off.
913
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:01.240
Shut it off.
914
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:01.420
Shut it off.
915
01:17:01.421 --> 01:17:03.440
I'm cutting it off, Jesus.
916
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.040
I'm trying to finish my twister.
917
01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360
I'm so pretentious.
918
01:17:07.345 --> 01:17:14.580
We'll cut the foul air and strike the
right person and only the right person.
919
01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:15.980
Oh, Bill?
920
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.960
Peter, what a nice surprise.
921
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.280
You okay?
922
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.680
Tell me.
923
01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.140
Yeah.
924
01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:28.940
You.
925
01:17:30.865 --> 01:17:33.540
There's been a lot of times since anyone's
asked me that.
926
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.980
And I'll let you mention it.
927
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880
No.
928
01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.420
I'm okay.
929
01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:49.330
There's my favorite toy from childhood.
930
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.341
It's supposed to play the drums,
but I think it's stuck.
931
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.610
Would you fix it for me?
932
01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.880
It was your grandfather's now.
933
01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.320
He brought it home from one of his trips.
934
01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:09.380
He was a pilot.
935
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.360
He was a pity-till.
936
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.460
Did you know it?
937
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.860
I don't know if it tells me anything.
938
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:17.910
Of course he doesn't.
939
01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.800
So this is it, then, huh?
940
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:23.271
The thing that most of them were not?
941
01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.020
No, good.
942
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:27.930
It's just a toy.
943
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.320
Why don't you try turning it?
944
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:36.060
Well, we just need a different touch.
945
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.020
Yeah.
946
01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.560
Turning the key is just simply something
to show.
947
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.480
More men have been doing for generations.
948
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.500
A tradition, if you will.
949
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:53.860
But if it's not for you, then it's not for
you.
950
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300
What does it do?
951
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.060
Turn the key.
952
01:19:01.065 --> 01:19:02.620
See what happened.
953
01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.200
You want me to back up?
954
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You're fucking moving.
955
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040
You're okay.
956
01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:58.860
Is it working?
957
01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.080
I had a stupid cop hat.
958
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.920
It's crazy, it's...
959
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.500
What?
960
01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:14.660
I'm getting so fucking Christ!
961
01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.460
How's we going with that pistol,
huh?
962
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:21.460
Yeah.
963
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.080
Totally.
964
01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:24.420
Yeah, great.
965
01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:01.490
Oh shit.
966
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:21.930
Fuck!
967
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:42.630
Hey.
968
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:46.010
Turn the key right now.
969
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.190
What?
970
01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:47.190
No.
971
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:49.250
They give me the fucking monkey right now.
972
01:21:51.850 --> 01:21:53.750
I'm not asking myself anymore.
973
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.710
Do it.
974
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.510
Kill him.
975
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:56.050
Kill him.
976
01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:57.210
Don't shit, brother!
977
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:58.470
Don't know!
978
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:01.470
Good.
979
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.050
Come here.
980
01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.870
Fight the goddamn front.
981
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:06.030
God.
982
01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:07.210
Fuck it.
983
01:22:07.211 --> 01:22:08.370
I can't make you.
984
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:11.990
Fuck it.
985
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:23.850
God damn it!
986
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:26.070
God!
987
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:28.650
I'm just so goddamn strong.
988
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:37.870
Hey.
989
01:22:39.090 --> 01:22:40.090
Hey, pity.
990
01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:41.670
Jesus Christ.
991
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:42.930
I thank God.
992
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.130
Come on.
993
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:45.790
God!
994
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:47.270
Damn it!
995
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.500
God!
996
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.920
God!
997
01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:16.650
Real.
998
01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:21.541
The drumsticks still have pity.
999
01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160
Hell, I'm shit.
1000
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.706
That's all you can say at a time like
this.
1001
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:26.730
You fucker.
1002
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.060
Don't shit.
1003
01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.460
Don't shit.
1004
01:24:28.461 --> 01:24:29.461
Fuck.
1005
01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.900
Fuck you.
1006
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.060
Jesus Christ, though.
1007
01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.320
You're really trying to kill me,
would you?
1008
01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.700
Of course it was.
1009
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.340
That's what all this carnage was for.
1010
01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.860
Could have killed a peaty.
1011
01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.220
Could have killed my fucking son.
1012
01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:49.720
Never what?
1013
01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:50.980
Why?
1014
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:54.420
Because you killed my mom.
1015
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.700
I know you wanted to kill me.
1016
01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.720
But the goddamn name doesn't take
requests, obviously.
1017
01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.261
I've been turning the keys.
1018
01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.240
You had my everyday's.
1019
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440
Listen, Bill.
1020
01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800
It's not my fault.
1021
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:38.810
I wasn't anybody's fault.
1022
01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.540
Not as deserved what happened to us.
1023
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:47.740
Just happened to be there when it did.
1024
01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:50.620
Mommy?
1025
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.180
I'm sorry, Bill.
1026
01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:00.840
But I guess I gotta go now.
1027
01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:03.180
Everybody dies.
1028
01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080
And that's life.
1029
01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:10.780
I'm sorry your mom died.
1030
01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.300
Fuckin' sucks.
1031
01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580
I know you're feeling.
1032
01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:21.860
She was my mom too.
1033
01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.260
Oh yeah.
1034
01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.460
I guess you are.
1035
01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.900
Never thought about it like that.
1036
01:26:37.315 --> 01:26:38.720
And it's a mistake I guess.
1037
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:40.680
Sure.
1038
01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.960
Makes sense though.
1039
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:47.200
We're brothers and twins.
1040
01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:48.280
Right?
1041
01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:54.660
I'm sorry.
1042
01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.200
I wish we could have been there for each
other when my kids.
1043
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.400
When we're here now.
1044
01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.580
When you say no.
1045
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.840
Brothers again.
1046
01:27:18.510 --> 01:27:19.510
Sure.
1047
01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.450
I'm sorry.
1048
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:37.030
I'm sorry.
1049
01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:49.310
So why'd you two wanna some kind of road
trip or something?
1050
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:51.630
Yeah.
1051
01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:55.130
I'm gonna...
Father's son road trip.
1052
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:56.490
Right?
1053
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.701
I would like to have done anything.
1054
01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.480
Somebody at least once.
1055
01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.480
So come with us.
1056
01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.180
So Uncle Bill pretty much... I'd
have to tell when you grew up huh?
1057
01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740
Yeah.
1058
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:14.080
You know I get to have everybody dies.
1059
01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.620
I mean that's life.
1060
01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:17.760
But this is like everybody dies.
1061
01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:19.780
You know what at the same time?
1062
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560
So...
1063
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.520
What do you wanna do now?
1064
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:34.640
I guess we gotta figure out what we're
gonna do with monkey.
1065
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600
We keep it close.
1066
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.400
We accept that it's ours and we hold on
tight.
1067
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.760
Hey, I just got an idea of what we should
do right now.
1068
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.700
Let's go dancing.
1069
01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:45.060
Dancing?
1070
01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820
Yeah.
1071
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.100
Like with our bodies?
1072
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:50.140
Where did that stick come from?
1073
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.660
Counts from your grandmother.
1074
01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600
I'm below us.
1075
01:31:03.490 --> 01:31:04.490
Cool.
1076
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:07.770
Yeah that's cool.
